It’s time to eat our veggies
So do the veggie dance

Now do the, now do the, now do the veggie dance
Yum, yum… Eat them up
Yum, yum… Eat them up
Yum, yum… Eat them up
Eat them up, eat them up
I love my veggies (Aye)

Lyrics:
Be honest
Be honest
Be honest
Always be honest and tell the truth
I’ll be honest and tell the truth
(I’ll tell the truth)
I’ll be honest and tell the truth
I know sometimes it is hard to do
But please be honest and tell the truth
I’ll be honest and tell the truth
(I’ll tell the truth)
Yes, I’ll tell the truth
Because it is the right thing to do
(Be honest)
I’ll tell the truth everyday
This is how you can trust what I say
(Be honest)
Hey, we all make mistakes
Like having big spills
 Or causing something to break
(Be honest)
It’s not always easy to do
But be brave, be honest
Tell others the truth
I’ll be honest and tell the truth
(I’ll tell the truth)
I’ll be honest and tell the truth
I know sometimes it is hard to do
But please be honest and tell the truth
I’ll be honest and tell the truth
(I’ll tell the truth)
Be honest
And tell the truth
Be honest
No matter what you do
Be honest
(Don’t forget)
Always be honest and tell the truth
Be honest
And tell the truth
Be honest
No matter what you do
Be honest
(Don’t forget)
Always be honest and tell the truth
I always will
(Be honest)
I always will
(Be honest)
Always be honest and tell the truth

Lyrics:
There were six in the bed
And the little one said “Roll over, roll over”
They all rolled over and one fell out
(Boom, boom, boom)
There were five in the bed
And the little one said “Roll over, roll over”
They all rolled over and one fell out
(Boom, boom, boom)
There were four in the bed
And the little one said “Roll over, roll over”
They all rolled over and one fell out
(Boom, boom, boom)
There were three in the bed
And the little one said “Roll over, roll over”
They all rolled over and one fell out
(Boom, boom, boom)
There were two in the bed
And the little one said “Roll over, roll over”
They all rolled over and one fell out
(Boom, boom, boom)
There was one in the bed
And the little one said “Good night, good night”
But then he felt lonely and wanted them back
(Alright, alright)
Aye, hop back in the bed
(One)
Aye, hop back in the bed
(Two)
Aye, hop back in the bed
(Three)
Aye, hop back in the bed
(Four)
Aye, hop back in the bed
(Five)
Aye, hop back in the bed
(Six)
Aye, hop back in the bed
Aye, time to rest your head
There were six in the bed
(How many?)
There were six in the bed
(How many?)
There were six in the bed
Six sleepy heads
There were six in the bed
(How many?)
There were six in the bed
(How many?)
There were six in the bed
Six sleepy heads

Lyrics:
I’m a little teapot
Short and stout
Here is my handle
Here is my spout
When I get all steamed up
Hear me shout
Tip me over and pour me out
I’m a little teapot
A little teapot
I’m a little teapot
Please pour me out
I’m a little teapot
A little teapot
I’m a little teapot
Please pour me out
I’m a little teapot
Short and stout
Here is my handle
Here is my spout
When I get all steamed up
Hear me shout
Tip me over and pour me out
I’m a little teapot
A little teapot
I’m a little teapot
Please pour me out
I’m a little teapot
A little teapot
I’m a little teapot
Please pour me out
Take your left hand
Put it on your hip
Lift your right hand in the air
Then tip
Take your left hand
Put it on your hip
Lift your right hand in the air
Then tip
I’m a little teapot
Short and stout
Here is my handle
Here is my spout
When I get all steamed up
Hear me shout
Tip me over and pour me out
I’m a little teapot
A little teapot
I’m a little teapot
Please pour me out
I’m a little teapot
A little teapot
I’m a little teapot
Please pour me out
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
A little teapot
Please pour me out
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
A little teapot
Please pour me out

Lyrics:
Do-do-do
Hush, little baby don't say a word
Mama's gonna buy you a mocking bird
(Mocking bird)
And if that mocking bird won't sing
Mama's gonna buy you a diamond ring
(Diamond ring)
And if that diamond ring turns brass
Mama's gonna buy you a looking glass
(Looking glass)
And if that looking glass gets broke
Mama's gonna buy you a billy goat
(Billy goat)
And if that billy goat won't pull
Mama's gonna buy you a cart and bull
(Cart and bull)
And if that cart and bull turn over
Mama's gonna buy you a dog named Rover
(Dog named Rover)
And if that dog named Rover won't bark
Mama's gonna buy you a horse and cart
(Horse and cart)
And if that horse and cart fall down
You'll still be the sweetest little baby in town

Hush little baby, don’t you cry
Hush little baby, dry your eyes

Hush little baby, hush little baby
Don’t you cry
Hush little baby, hush little baby
Dry your eyes

Hush, little baby don't say a word
Mama's gonna buy you a mocking bird
(Mocking bird)
And if that mocking bird won't sing
Mama's gonna buy you a diamond ring
(Diamond ring)
And if that diamond ring turns brass
Mama's gonna buy you a looking glass
(Looking glass)
And if that looking glass gets broke
Mama's gonna buy you a billy goat
(Billy goat)
And if that billy goat won't pull
Mama's gonna buy you a cart and bull
(Cart and bull)
And if that cart and bull turn over
Mama's gonna buy you a dog named Rover
(Dog named Rover)
And if that dog named Rover won't bark
Mama's gonna buy you a horse and cart
(Horse and cart)
And if that horse and cart fall down
You'll still be the sweetest little baby in town

Hush little baby, hush little baby
Don’t you cry
Hush little baby, hush little baby
Dry your eyes
Don’t you cry

Lyrics:
One, two, three, four, five,
Once I caught a fish alive,
Six, seven, eight, nine, ten,
Then I let it go again.
Why did you let it go?
Because it bit my finger so.
Which finger did it bite?
This little finger on the right
One, two, three, four, five,
Once I caught a fish alive,
Six, seven, eight, nine, ten,
Then I let it go again.
Why did you let it go?
Because it bit my finger so.
Which finger did it bite?
This little finger on the right
Oh oh…Got to let it go
Got to let it go go
Got to let it go, oh oh
Oh oh…Got to let it go
Got to let it go go
Got to let it go, oh oh
Tell me which finger did it bite
Tell me which finger did it bite
This little finger on the right
This little finger on the right
Tell me which finger did it bite
Tell me which finger did it bite
This little finger on the right
This little finger on the right
One, two, three, four, five,
Once I caught a fish alive,
Six, seven, eight, nine, ten,
Then I let it go again.

Why did you let it go?
Because it bit my finger so.
Which finger did it bite?
This little finger on the right
One, two, three, four, five,
Once I caught a fish alive,
Six, seven, eight, nine, ten,
Then I let it go again.

Why did you let it go?
Because it bit my finger so.
Which finger did it bite?
This little finger on the right
Oh oh…Got to let it go
Got to let it go go
Got to let it go, oh oh
Oh oh…Got to let it go
Got to let it go go
Got to let it go, oh oh
Tell me which finger did it bite
Tell me which finger did it bite
This little finger on the right
This little finger on the right
Tell me which finger did it bite
Tell me which finger did it bite
This little finger on the right
This little finger on the right

You give your hand a shake, shake, shake,
And turn yourself about.

You put your left hand in.
You put your left hand out.
You give your hand a shake, shake, shake,
And turn yourself about.

You put your right foot in.
You put your right foot out.
You give your foot a shake, shake, shake,
And turn yourself about.
