                You may be eligible to pay for your purchase of NFL Sunday

                with your Google account, you will need to create one. If you
                pay for your purchase of NFL Sunday Ticket through a monthly
                payment plan, your first payment will be charged on the date of
                your purchase. You will then be automatically charged on a
                monthly basis for all remaining payments due for that season.
                Once your first payment is charged, you won't be able to cancel
                your membership for the season you purchased.

                through a monthly payment plan, your membership will renew each
                season at the then-current full season price plus any applicable
                taxes and discounts. This amount will be charged every season in
                4 monthly payments starting on your membership renewal date,
                unless you cancel your membership before it renews. To manage
                your membership go to your YouTube Purchase &amp; Memberships

                You will generally receive out-of-market Sunday afternoon games
                unless the game is locally broadcast. A regular season Sunday
                afternoon home game could also be blacked out within the home
                territory of the home team if the game fails to sell out. Your
                billing address (zip code) is associated with your streaming
                access. However, due to NFL rules, you might also see blackout
                restrictions based on your mobile device's location (e.g.,
                subscribers might not be able to stream while attending an NFL
                game or surrounding stadium areas). If there is an outage in
                your location, we'll do our best to let you know.
