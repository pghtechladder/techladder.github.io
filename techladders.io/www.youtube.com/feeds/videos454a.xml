   <media:description>Sometimes the best way to support someone (or yourself) is to simply listen without judgment. This is called &quot;holding space.&quot;
In this video, I'll break down what holding space means, how to practice it, and why it's so powerful. You'll learn:
• The difference between holding space and trying to fix problems
• How to hold space for your own difficult emotions
• Tips for holding space for the people you care about
I'll also share my new program, Mindful Moments Weekly, which offers guided audio tools to cultivate self-compassion and resilience.
