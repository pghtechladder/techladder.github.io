Good Thing We Didn't Throw This Out! Julia's favorite candy is the cranberry hard candy. So after one of the cranberry batches stuck together the idea came to life! Instead of throwing out the stuck together cranberry hard candy we smashed it up into little tiny pieces and made a bark out of it!

💑 About Hercules Candy
Hercules Candy has been on Steve’s side of the family since 1910(ish). When he took over in the 70’s, he anticipated after 10 years of hard work, he could move the business out of the basement and into a real storefront. Unfortunately, it took until 2018 for that to happen, but hey at least it happened! Steve and Terry own the shop, Craig (the social media manager) is their son, Cara (wrapper and shipper extraordinaire who is poised to take over the shop one day) is their daughter and Leah (who doesn’t love being on camera and is very elusive) is their oldest daughter. Karen has been working for Hercules Candy since the twins (Craig and Cara) were about 6 months old and everybody else is a new recruit. Don’t forget to subscribe and hit the 🔔 for more videos!

💑 About Hercules Candy
Hercules Candy has been on Steve’s side of the family since 1910(ish). When he took over in the 70’s, he anticipated after 10 years of hard work, he could move the business out of the basement and into a real storefront. Unfortunately, it took until 2018 for that to happen, but hey at least it happened! Steve and Terry own the shop, Craig (the social media manager) is their son, Cara (wrapper and shipper extraordinaire who is poised to take over the shop one day) is their daughter and Leah (who doesn’t love being on camera and is very elusive) is their oldest daughter. Karen has been working for Hercules Candy since the twins (Craig and Cara) were about 6 months old and everybody else is a new recruit. Don’t forget to subscribe and hit the 🔔 for more videos!

   <media:description>This candy took over a week to make, but it was worth every second! First we made the double chocolate coated cherries. Then we let them sit for a week so they could get juicier over time. Then we covered THAT in truffle batter before the final coating of chocolate! And they take so long to make that we made less than 50 of them. So get them while you still can!

💑 About Hercules Candy
Hercules Candy has been on Steve’s side of the family since 1910(ish). When he took over in the 70’s, he anticipated after 10 years of hard work, he could move the business out of the basement and into a real storefront. Unfortunately, it took until 2018 for that to happen, but hey at least it happened! Steve and Terry own the shop, Craig (the social media manager) is their son, Cara (wrapper and shipper extraordinaire who is poised to take over the shop one day) is their daughter and Leah (who doesn’t love being on camera and is very elusive) is their oldest daughter. Karen has been working for Hercules Candy since the twins (Craig and Cara) were about 6 months old and everybody else is a new recruit. Don’t forget to subscribe and hit the 🔔 for more videos!
